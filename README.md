# EXCEL-HOTEL BOOKING PROJECT

I’m excited to share that I’ve created a fantastic Excel dashboard report using various functions and techniques, based on hotel booking data. This dashboard provides numerous insights that can help improve business operations.

The raw data includes the following columns:

is_canceled
arrival_date_year
arrival_date_month
arrival_date_week_number
arrival_date_day_of_month
stays_in_weekend_nights
stays_in_week_nights
adults
children
babies
country
reserved_room_type
assigned_room_type
reservation_status
reservation_status_date
room status
guest type


I’ve cleaned the data and applied various Excel functions to create a comprehensive dashboard. The insights derived from this dashboard are aimed at enhancing business performance and decision-making.
